 Anarchism

Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates stateless societies often defined as self-governed voluntary institutions but that several authors have defined as more specific institutions based on non-hierarchical free associations Anarchism holds the state to be undesirable unnecessary or harmful While anti-statism is central anarchism entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of human relations including but not limited to the state system.
As a subtle and anti-dogmatic philosophy anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy There are many types and traditions of anarchism not all of which are mutually exclusive Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications Anarchism is usually considered a radical left-wing ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflect anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism collectivism syndicalism mutualism or participatory economics.
The central tendency of anarchism as a social movement has been represented by anarcho-communism and anarcho-syndicalism with individualist anarchism being primarily a literary phenomenon which nevertheless did have an impact on the bigger currents and individualists have also participated in large anarchist organisations Many anarchists oppose all forms of aggression supporting self-defense or non-violence anarcho-pacifism while others have supported the use of some coercive measures including violent revolution and propaganda of the deed as means to achieve anarchist ends.
Etymology and terminology.
The term anarchism is a compound word composed from the word anarchy and the suffix -ism themselves derived respectively from the Greek i.e anarchy from anarchos meaning one without rulers from the privative prefix ἀν- an- i.e without and archos i.e leader ruler cf archon or arkhē i.e authority sovereignty realm magistracy and the suffix or -ismos -isma from the verbal infinitive suffix -ίζειν -izein The first known use of this word was in 1539."Anarchist was the term adopted by Maximilien de Robespierre to attack those on the left whom he had used for his own ends during the Revolution but was determined to get rid of though among these anarchists there were few who exhibited the social revolt characteristics of later anarchists There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation such as William Godwin and Wilhelm Weitling but they did not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-nineteenth century Since the 1890s from France the term libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the United_States States its use as a synonym is still common outside the United_States States On the other hand some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only referring to free-market anarchism as libertarian anarchism".
History.
Origins.
The earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century BC among the works of Taoist philosopher Laozi and in later centuries by Zhuangzi and Bao Jingyan Zhuangzi's philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist Zhuangzi wrote A petty thief is put in jail A great brigand becomes a ruler of a Nation Diogenes of Sinope and the Cynics their contemporary Zeno of Citium the founder of Stoicism also introduced similar topics Jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the Christian anarchist tradition Georges Lechartier wrote that The true founder of anarchy was Jesus Christ and the first anarchist society was that of the apostles In early Islamic history some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the Islamic civil war over the Caliphate where the Kharijites insisted that the imamate is a right for each individual within the Islamic society Later some Muslim scholars such as Amer al-Basri and Abu Hanifa led movements of boycotting the rulers paving the way to the waqf endowments tradition which served as an alternative to and asylum from the centralized authorities of the emirs But such interpretations reverberates subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic Taoist teachings and that of other anti-authoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not anarchism and religion are compatible This is exemplified when the glorification of the state is viewed as a form of sinful idolatry.
The renaissance political philosopher Étienne de La Boétie wrote in his most famous work the Discourse on Voluntary Servitude what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent.
The radical Protestant Christian Gerrard Winstanley and his group the Diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in England The term anarchist first entered the English language in 1642 during the English Civil War as a term of abuse used by Royalists against their Roundhead opponents By the time of the Revolution some such as the Enragés began to use the term positively in opposition to Jacobin centralisation of power seeing revolutionary government as oxymoronic By the turn of the 19th century the English word anarchism had lost its initial negative connotation.
Modern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the Enlightenment particularly Jean-Jacques Rousseau's arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.
As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the Revolution William Godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought Godwin was according to Peter Kropotkin the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early Edmund Burke.
Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as philosophical anarchism He argued in Political Justice 1793 that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power Rather he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.
His aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce as a manifestation of the people’s ‘mental enslavement’ the foundations of law property rights and even the institution of marriage He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation In each case government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment.
The Pierre-Joseph Proudhon is regarded as the first self-proclaimed anarchist a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work What is Property published in 1840 It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory He developed the theory of spontaneous order in society where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests his famous quote on the matter is Liberty is the mother not the daughter of order In What is Property Proudhon answers with the famous accusation Property is theft In this work he opposed the institution of decreed property propriété where owners have complete rights to use and abuse their property as they wish He contrasted this with what he called possession or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use Later however Proudhon added that Property is Liberty and argued that it was a bulwark against state power His opposition to the state organised religion and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time.
The anarcho-communist Joseph Déjacque was the first person to describe himself as libertarian Unlike Pierre-Joseph Proudhon he argued that it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to but to the satisfaction of his or her needs whatever may be their nature anarchists active in the 1848 Revolution included Anselme Bellegarrigue Ernest Coeurderoy Joseph Déjacque and Pierre Joseph Proudhon.
First International and the Paris Commune.
In Europe harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848 during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists anarchists liberals and nationalists to prevent further revolt In Spain Ramón de la Sagra established the anarchist journal Porvenir in La Coruña in 1845 which was inspired by Proudhon´s ideas The Catalan politician Francesc Pi i Margall became the principal translator of Proudhon's works into Spanish and later briefly became president of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party According to George Woodcock These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870 but before that time Proudhonian ideas as interpreted by Pi already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's According to the Encyclopedia Britannica During the Spanish revolution of 1873 Pi y Margall attempted to establish a decentralized or “cantonalist,” political system on Proudhonian lines."
In 1864 the International Workingmen's Association sometimes called the First International united diverse revolutionary currents including followers of Proudhon Blanquists Philadelphes English trade unionists socialists and social democrats Due to its links to active workers movements the International became a significant organisation Karl Marx became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council Proudhon's followers the mutualists opposed Marx's state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings Woodcock also reports that the individualist anarchists Lysander Spooner and William B Greene had been members of the First International In 1868 following their unsuccessful participation in the League of Peace and Freedom LPF Russian revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the First International which had decided not to get involved with the LPF They allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the International who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property At first the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction Subsequently the International became polarised into two camps with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as centralist and predicted that if a Marxist party came to power its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports that The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune and in 1871 the General Council called only a special conference in London One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy while a technical excuse – that they had split away from the Fédération Romande – was used to avoid inviting Bakunin's Swiss supporters Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present and the General Council's resolutions passed almost unanimously Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers In 1872 the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the Hague Congress where Bakunin and James Guillaume were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to York In response the federalist sections formed their own International at the St Imier Congress adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.
The Paris Commune was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March more formally from 28 March to 28 May 1871 The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune They included George Woodcock states:
Organised labour.
The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists seeking to replace the privilege and authority of the State with the free and spontaneous organisation of labour In 1886 the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions FOTLU of the United_States States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886 as the date by which the eight-hour work day would become standard.
In response unions across the United_States States prepared a general strike in support of the event On 3 May in Chicago a fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd The next day 4 May anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally killing an officer In the ensuing panic police opened fire on the crowd and each other Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution The incident became known as the Haymarket affair and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day In 1890 a second attempt this time international in scope to organise for the eight-hour day was made The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event by the following year the celebration of International Workers Day on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.
In 1907 the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam gathered delegates from 14 different countries among which important figures of the anarchist movement including Errico Malatesta Pierre Monatte Luigi Fabbri Benoît Broutchoux Emma Goldman Rudolf Rocker and Christiaan Cornelissen Various themes were treated during the Congress in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement popular education issues the general strike or antimilitarism A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism or trade unionism Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient He thought that the trade-union movement was reformist and even conservative citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.
The Spanish Workers Federation in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain The most successful was the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo National Confederation of Labour CNT founded in 1910 Before the 1940s the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the Spanish Civil War The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922 with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America In Latin America in particular The anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout and America and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in Mexico Brazil Peru Chile and Argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook the prestige of the Spanish C.N.T as a revolutionary organization was
undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation The largest and most militant of these organizations was the Federación Obrera Regional Argentina it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions."
Propaganda of the deed and illegalism.
Some anarchists such as Johann Most advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because we preach not only action in and for itself but also action as propaganda By the 1880s people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan propaganda of the deed to refer to individual bombings regicides and tyrannicides From 1905 onwards the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal expropriations Illegalism as a practice emerged and within it The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins propaganda by the deed and the anarchist burglars individual reappropriation expressed their desperation and their personal violent rejection of an intolerable society Moreover they were clearly meant to be exemplary invitations to revolt France's Bonnot Gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.
However as soon as 1887 important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts Peter Kropotkin thus wrote that year in Le Révolté that a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action for example through the trade union movement The anarcho-syndicalist Fernand Pelloutier argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without the individual dynamiter."
State repression including the infamous 1894 lois scélérates of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics although reciprocally state repression in the first place may have played a role in these isolated acts The dismemberment of the socialist movement into many groups and following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies favoured individualist political expression and acts.
Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement For example U.S President McKinley's assassin Leon Czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist Emma Goldman Bombings were associated in the media with anarchists because international terrorism arose during this time period with the widespread distribution of dynamite This image remains to this day.
Propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after World War I 1914–1918 and the 1917 October Revolution.
Russian Revolution and other uprisings of the 1910s.
Anarchists participated alongside the Bolsheviks in both February and October revolutions and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution However following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition the conflict culminated in the 1921 Kronstadt rebellion which the new government repressed Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to the Ukraine There in the Free Territory they fought in the civil war against the Whites a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution and then the Bolsheviks as part of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine led by Nestor Makhno who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.
Expelled anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising before they left Russia Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia criticising the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised For them Bakunin's predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new socialist Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true.
The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements In France and the United_States States for example members of the major syndicalist movements of the CGT and IWW left the organisations and joined the Communist International.
The revolutionary wave of 1917–23 saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism In the German uprising known as the German Revolution of 1918–1919 which established the Bavarian Soviet Republic the anarchists Gustav Landauer Silvio Gesell and Erich Mühsam had important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist structures In the Italian events known as the biennio rosso the anarcho-syndicalist trade union Unione Sindacale Italiana grew to 800,000 members and the influence of the Italian Anarchist Union 20,000 members plus Umanita Nova its daily paper grew accordingly Anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces In the Mexican Revolution the Mexican Liberal Party was established and during the early 1910s it led a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in Baja California with the leadership of anarcho-communist Ricardo Flores Magón.
In Paris the Dielo Truda group of Russian anarchist exiles which included Nestor Makhno concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism Their 1926 manifesto called the Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists Draft was supported Platformist groups active today include the Workers Solidarity Movement in Ireland and the North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists of North America Synthesis anarchism emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives In the 1920s this form found as its main proponents Volin and Sebastien Faure It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations.
Conflicts with European fascist regimes.
In the 1920s and 1930s the rise of fascism in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists Italian anarchists played a key role in the anti-fascist organisation Arditi del Popolo which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and achieved some success in their activism such as repelling Blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of Parma in August 1922 The veteran Italian anarchist Luigi Fabbri was one of the first critical theorists of fascism describing it as the preventive counter-revolution In France where the far right leagues came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots anarchists divided over a united front policy.
Anarchists in France and Italy were active in the Resistance during World War II In Germany the anarchist Erich Mühsam was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of 28 February 1933 within a few hours after the Reichstag fire in Berlin Joseph Goebbels the Nazi propaganda minister labelled him as one of those Jewish subversives Over the next seventeen months he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at Sonnenburg Brandenburg and finally Oranienburg On 2 February 1934 Mühsam was transferred to the concentration camp at Oranienburg when finally on the night of 9 July 1934 Mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning.
Spanish Revolution.
In Spain the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union Confederación Nacional del Trabajo initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory But in 1936 the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power Months later the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the Spanish Civil War 1936–1939 In response to the army rebellion an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain where they collectivised the land But even before the fascist victory in 1939 the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the Stalinists who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the Soviet Union The events known as the Spanish Revolution was a workers social revolution that began during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years primarily Catalonia Aragon Andalusia and parts of the Levante Much of Spain's economy was put under worker control in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia the figure was as high as 75% but lower in areas with heavy Communist Party of Spain influence as the Soviet-allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivization enactment Factories were run through worker committees agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes Anarchist historian Sam Dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution which he claimed came closer to realizing the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history."
Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident Marxists and anarchists The prominent Italian anarchist Camillo Berneri who volunteered to fight against Franco was killed instead in Spain by gunmen associated with the Spanish Communist Party.
Post-war years.
Anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time such as Albert Camus Herbert Read Paul Goodman Dwight Macdonald Allen Ginsberg George Woodcock Leopold Kohr Julian Beck John Cage and the Surrealist group led by André Breton which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the Fédération Anarchiste.
Anarcho-pacifism became influential in the Anti-nuclear movement and anti war movements of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the English anarchist member of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Alex Comfort or the similar activism of the catholic anarcho-pacifists Ammon Hennacy and Dorothy Day Anarcho-pacifism became a basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the Cold War The resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in Robert Graham's Volume Two The Emergence of the Anarchism 1939–1977)".
Contemporary anarchism.
In the United_Kingdom Kingdom in the 1970s this was associated with the punk rock movement as exemplified by bands such as Crass and the Sex Pistols The housing and employment crisis in most of Europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of Barcelona Spain In Denmark squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the Freetown Christiania an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen Since the revival of anarchism in the mid 20th century a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of anarcha-feminism they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s Anarchist anthropologist David Graeber and anarchist historian Andrej Grubacic have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism with those who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are much more informed among other elements by indigenous feminist ecological and cultural-critical ideas and who by the turn of the 21st century formed by far the majority of anarchists.
Around the turn of the 21st century anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war anti-capitalist and anti-globalisation movements Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the World Trade Organization WTO Group of Eight and the World Economic Forum Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting property destruction and violent confrontations with police These actions were precipitated by ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet A significant event of this period was the confrontations at WTO conference in Seattle in 1999 According to anarchist scholar Simon Critchley contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary neo-liberalism One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility whether sexual ecological or socio-economic it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the ravages the rest it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally."
International anarchist federations in existence include the International of Anarchist Federations the International Workers Association and International Libertarian Solidarity.
The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain in the form of the Confederación General del Trabajo CGT and the CNT CGT membership was estimated at around 100,000 for 2003 Other active syndicalist movements include in Sweden the Organisation of the Workers of Sweden and the Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation the CNT-AIT in France the Union Sindicale Italiana in Italy in the US Workers Solidarity Alliance and the UK Solidarity Federation and Anarchist Federation The revolutionary industrial unionist Industrial Workers of the World claiming 2,000 paying members and the International Workers Association an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the First International also remain active.
Anarchist schools of thought.
Anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions individualist anarchism and social anarchism which have some different origins values and evolution The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty i.e opposition to state or social control over the individual while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve one's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfill recognizing equality of entitlement In a chronological and theoretical sense there are classical – those created throughout the 19th century – and post-classical anarchist schools – those created since the mid-20th century and after.
Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it A component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a minimal state as unfortunate and usually temporary necessary evil but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives a call for toleration first adopted by Fernando Tarrida del Mármol in 1889 in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms i.e collectivist- communist- mutualist– and individualist-anarchism it sought to emphasise the anti-authoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought.
Classical anarchist schools of thought.
Mutualism.
Mutualism began in 18th-century English and labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in France and others in the United_States States Proudhon proposed spontaneous order whereby organisation emerges without central authority a positive anarchy where order arises when everybody does what he wishes and only what he wishes and where business transactions alone produce the social order It is important to recognize that Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance For this reason much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance Proudhon was heavily involved in parliamentary politics and allied himself not with Anarchist but Socialist factions of workers movements and in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned cooperatives promoted certain nationalization schemes during his life of public service.
Mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity free association voluntary contract federation and credit and currency reform According to the mutualist William Batchelder Greene each worker in the mutualist system would receive just and exact pay for his work services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost without profit or discount Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism."Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought Blackwell Publishing 1991 ISBN 0-631-17944-5 p 11.</ref> Proudhon first characterised his goal as a third form of society the synthesis of communism and property."
Individualist anarchism.
Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups society traditions and ideological systems Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.
In 1793 William Godwin who has often been cited as the first anarchist wrote Political Justice which some consider the first expression of anarchism Godwin a philosophical anarchist from a rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present necessary evil that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge Godwin advocated individualism proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good.
An influential form of individualist anarchism called egoism or egoist anarchism was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism the German Max Stirner Stirner's The Ego and Its Own published in 1844 is a founding text of the philosophy According to Stirner the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire without regard for God state or morality To Stirner rights were spooks in the mind and he held that society does not exist but the individuals are its reality Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw unions of egoists non-systematic associations continually renewed by all parties support through an act of will which Stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state Egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals Egoism has inspired many interpretations of Stirner's philosophy It was re-discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and LGBT activist John Henry Mackay.
Josiah Warren is widely regarded as the first anarchist and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833 The Peaceful Revolutionist was the first anarchist periodical published For anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster It is apparent that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United_States States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews William B Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form Henry David Thoreau 1817–1862 was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United_States States and Europe Thoreau was an author poet naturalist tax resister development critic surveyor historian philosopher and leading transcendentalist He is best known for his books Walden a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings and his essay Civil Disobedience an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state Later Benjamin Tucker fused Stirner's egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication Liberty".
From these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals free love and birth control advocates see Anarchism and issues related to love and sex individualist naturists nudists see anarcho-naturism freethought and anti-clerical activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation see European individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in France These authors and activists included Oscar Wilde Emile Armand Han Ryner Henri Zisly Renzo Novatore Miguel Gimenez Igualada Adolf Brand and Lev Chernyi among others.
Social anarchism.
Social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations without any government authority or coercion It is the largest school of thought in anarchism Social anarchism rejects private property seeing it as a source of social inequality while retaining respect for personal property and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid.
Collectivist anarchism.
Collectivist anarchism also referred to as revolutionary socialism or a form of such is a revolutionary form of anarchism commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin and Johann Most Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production instead advocating that ownership be collectivised This was to be achieved through violent revolution first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence or propaganda by the deed which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production.
However collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income as workers would be paid according to time worked rather than receiving goods being distributed according to need as in anarcho-communism This position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively uphold the wages system Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with Marxism but opposed the Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society Anarchist communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.
Anarcho-communism.
Anarchist communism also known as anarcho-communism libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state markets money private property while retaining respect for personal property and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle from each according to his ability to each according to his need".
Some forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism believing anarcho-communism is the best social system for the realization of individual freedom Most anarcho-communists view anarcho-communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society.
Anarcho-communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the revolution but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the First International The theoretical work of Peter Kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro-organisationalist and insurrectionary anti-organisationalist sections To date the best known examples of an anarchist communist society i.e established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon are the anarchist territories during the Spanish Revolution and the Free Territory during the Russian Revolution Through the efforts and influence of the Spanish Anarchists during the Spanish Revolution within the Spanish Civil War starting in 1936 anarchist communism existed in most of Aragon parts of the Levante and Andalusia as well as in the stronghold of Anarchist Catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of the regime that won the war Hitler Mussolini Spanish Communist Party repression backed by the USSR as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself During the Russian Revolution anarchists such as Nestor Makhno worked to create and defend – through the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine – anarchist communism in the Free Territory of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921.
Anarcho-syndicalism.
Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the labour movement Anarcho-syndicalists view labour unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are Workers solidarity Direct action and Workers self-management
Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only direct action – that is action concentrated on directly attaining a goal as opposed to indirect action such as electing a representative to a government position – will allow workers to liberate themselves Moreover anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers organisations the organisations that struggle against the wage system which in anarcho-syndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of a new society should be self-managing They should not have bosses or business agents rather the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves Rudolf Rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement He outlined a view of the origins of the movement what it sought and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet Anarcho-Syndicalism The International Workers Association is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries The Spanish Confederación Nacional del Trabajo played and still plays a major role in the Spanish labour movement It was also an important force in the Spanish Civil War.
Post-classical schools of thought.
Anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements at times eclectic drawing upon various sources and syncretic combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches.
Green anarchism or eco-anarchism is a school of thought within anarchism that emphasizes environmental issues with an important precedent in anarcho-naturism and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho-primitivism and social ecology.
Anarcha-feminism also called anarchist feminism and anarcho-feminism combines anarchism with feminism It generally views patriarchy as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralised free association Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle and the anarchist struggle against the state In essence the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice-versa L Susan Brown claims that as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power it is inherently feminist Anarcha-feminism began with the late 19th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as Emma Goldman and Voltairine de Cleyre.
Anarcho-pacifism is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change see non-violence It developed mostly in the Britain and the United_States States before and during the Second World War Christian anarchism is a movement in political theology that combines anarchism and Christianity Its main proponents included Leo Tolstoy Dorothy Day Ammon Hennacy and Jacques Ellul.
Platformism is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of Dielo Truda's Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists Draft The document was based on the experiences of Russian anarchists in the 1917 October Revolution which led eventually to the victory of the Bolsheviks over the anarchists and other groups The Platform attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement's failures during the Russian Revolution.
Synthesis anarchism is a form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives In the 1920s this form found as its main proponents the anarcho-communists Voline and Sébastien Faure It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations.
Post-left anarchy is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism's relationship to traditional Left-wing politics Some post-leftists seek to escape the confines of ideology in general also presenting a critique of organisations and morality Influenced by the work of Max Stirner and by the Marxist Situationist International post-left anarchy is marked by a focus on social insurrection and a rejection of leftist social organisation.
Insurrectionary anarchism is a revolutionary theory practice and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasizes insurrection within anarchist practice It is critical of formal organisations such as labour unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses Instead insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organisation and small affinity group based organisation Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack permanent class conflict and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.
Post-anarchism is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought drawing from diverse ideas including post-modernism autonomist marxism post-left anarchy Situationist International and postcolonialism.
Left-wing market anarchism strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support strongly anti-corporatist anti-hierarchical pro-labor positions and anti-capitalism in economics and anti-imperialism in foreign policy.
Anarcho-capitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favour of individual sovereignty in a free market Anarcho-capitalism developed from radical anti-state libertarianism and individualist anarchism There is a strong current within anarchism which does not consider that anarcho-capitalism can be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti-capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism incompatible with capitalist forms.
Internal issues and debates.
Anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes tendencies and schools of thought as such disagreement over questions of values ideology and tactics is common The compatibility of capitalism nationalism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed Similarly anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as Marxism communism and capitalism Anarchists may be motivated by humanism divine authority enlightened self-interest veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.
Phenomena such as civilization technology e.g within anarcho-primitivism and insurrectionary anarchism and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.
On a tactical level while propaganda of the deed was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century e.g the Nihilist movement some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative direct action methods such as nonviolence counter-economics and anti-state cryptography to bring about an anarchist society About the scope of an anarchist society some anarchists advocate a global one while others do so by local ones The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has led to many definitional concerns in anarchist theory.
Topics of interest.
Intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory.
Free love.
An important current within anarchism is free love Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to Josiah Warren and to experimental communities viewed sexual freedom as a clear direct expression of an individual's sovereignty Free love particularly stressed women's rights since most sexual laws discriminated against women for example marriage laws and anti-birth control measures The most important free love journal was Lucifer the Lightbearer 1883–1907 edited by Moses Harman and Lois Waisbrooker but also there existed Ezra Heywood and Angela Heywood's The Word 1872–1890 1892–1893 Free Society 1895–1897 as The Firebrand 1897–1904 as Free Society was a major anarchist newspaper in the United_States States at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries The publication advocated free love and women's rights and critiqued Comstockery – censorship of sexual information Also M E Lazarus was an important individualist anarchist who promoted free love.
In York City's Greenwich Village bohemian feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women and also men in the here and now They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality and the openly bisexual radical Edna St Vincent Millay and the lesbian anarchist Margaret Anderson were prominent among them Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by Emma Goldman among others Magnus Hirschfeld noted in 1923 that Goldman has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights and especially for those deprived of their rights Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman indeed the first and only to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public In fact before Goldman heterosexual anarchist Robert Reitzel 1849–1898 spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his Detroit-based German language journal Der arme Teufel In Argentina anarcha-feminist Virginia Bolten published the newspaper called which was published nine times in Rosario between 8 January 1896 and 1 January 1897 and was revived briefly in 1901.
In Europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was Emile Armand He proposed the concept of la camaraderie amoureuse to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults He was also a consistent proponent of polyamory In Germany the stirnerists Adolf Brand and John Henry Mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality Mujeres Libres was an anarchist women's organisation in Spain that aimed to empower working class women It was founded in 1936 by Lucía Sánchez Saornil Mercedes Comaposada and Amparo Poch y Gascón and had approximately 30,000 members The organisation was based on the idea of a double struggle for women's liberation and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel In order to gain mutual support they created networks of women anarchists Lucía Sánchez Saornil was a main founder of the Spanish anarcha-feminist federation Mujeres Libres who was open about her lesbianism She was published in a variety of literary journals where working under a male pen name she was able to explore lesbian themes at a time when homosexuality was criminalized and subject to censorship and punishment.
More recently the anarcho-pacifist Alex Comfort gained notoriety during the sexual revolution for writing the bestseller sex manual The Joy of Sex The issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of anarcho-hedonist philosopher Michel Onfray in such works as Théorie du corps amoureux pour une érotique solaire 2000 and L'invention du plaisir fragments cyréaniques 2002).
Libertarian education and freethought.
In the United_States States freethought was a basically anti-christian anti-clerical movement whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters A number of contributors to Liberty anarchist publication were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of Freethought and for a time The Truth Seeker E.C Walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal Lucifer the Light-Bearer Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers reprints from freethought papers such as Lucifer the Light-Bearer Freethought and The Truth Seeker appeared in Liberty"... The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself".
In 1901 Catalan anarchist and free-thinker Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia established modern or progressive schools in Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church The schools stated goal was to educate the working class in a rational secular and non-coercive setting Fiercely anti-clerical Ferrer believed in freedom in education education free from the authority of church and state Murray Bookchin wrote This period was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was Francisco Ferrer's Modern School Escuela Moderna a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally La Escuela Moderna and Ferrer's ideas generally formed the inspiration for a series of Modern Schools in the United_States States Cuba America and London The first of these was started in York City in 1911 It also inspired the Italian newspaper Università popolare founded in 1901 Russian christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy established a school for peasant children on his estate Tolstoy's educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police Tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture He thought that Education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself Education is culture under restraint culture is free is when the teaching is forced upon the pupil and when then instruction is exclusive that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary For him without compulsion education was transformed into culture".
A more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of unschooling and the free school in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches Experiments in Germany led to A S Neill founding what became Summerhill School in 1921 Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice However although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle-approach.
In addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se The term deschooling was popularised by Ivan Illich who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.
Criticisms.
Criticisms of anarchism include moral criticisms and pragmatic criticisms Anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or utopian by its critics European history professor Carl Landauer in his book European Socialism argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a lesser evil than a society without repressive force He also argued that ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears is an absurdity."

Anime

Anime are Japanese animated productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation The word is the abbreviated pronunciation of animation in Japanese where this term references all animation In other languages the term is defined as animation from Japan or as a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics vibrant characters and fantastic themes Arguably the stylization approach to the meaning may open up the possibility of anime produced in countries other than Japan For simplicity many Westerners strictly view anime as an animation product from Japan.
The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917 and production of anime works in Japan has since continued to increase steadily The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally in the late twentieth century developing a large domestic and international audience Anime is distributed theatrically by television broadcasts directly to home media and over the internet and is classified into numerous genres targeting diverse broad and niche audiences.
Anime is a diverse art form with distinctive production methods and techniques that have been adapted over time in response to emergent technologies The production of anime focuses less on the animation of movement and more on the realism of settings as well as the use of camera effects including panning zooming and angle shots Diverse art styles are used and character proportions and features can be quite varied including characteristically large emotive or realistically sized eyes.
The anime industry consists of over 430 production studios including major names like Studio Ghibli Gainax and Toei Animation Despite having a fraction of the domestic film market anime achieves a majority of DVD sales and has been an international success after the rise of televised English dubs This rise in international popularly has resulted in non-Japanese productions using the anime art style but these works have been defined as anime-influenced animation by both fans and the industry.
Definition and usage.
Anime is an art form specifically animation that includes all genres found in cinema but it can be mistakenly classified as a genre In Japan the term anime refers to all forms of animation from around the world English-language dictionaries define anime as a Japanese-style animated film or television entertainment or as a style of animation created in Japan".
The etymology of the word anime is disputed The English term animation is written in Japanese katakana as アニメーション animēshon pronounced and is アニメ anime in its shortened form Some sources claim that anime derives from the term for animation dessin animé but others believe this to be a myth derived from the popularity of the medium in the late 1970s and 1980s In English anime when used as a common noun normally functions as a mass noun for example Do you watch anime How much anime have you collected Prior to the widespread use of anime the term Japanimation was prevalent throughout the 1970s and 1980s In the mid-1980s the term anime began to supplant Japanimation In general the term now only appears in period works where it is used to distinguish and identify Japanese animation.
In 1987 Hayao Miyazaki stated that he despised the truncated word Anime because to him it represented the desolation of the Japanese animation industry He equated the desolation with animators lacking motivation and mass-produced overly expressive products which rely on fixed iconography for facial expressions and protracted and exaggerated action scenes but lack depth and sophistication because they do not attempt to convey emotion or thought.
Format.
The first format of anime was theatrical viewing which originally began with commercial productions in 1917 Originally the animated flips were crude and required played musical components before adding sound and vocal components to the production On July 14 1958 Nippon Television aired Mole's Adventure both the first televised and first color anime to debut It wasn't until the 1960s when the first televised series were broadcast and it has remained a popular medium since Works released in a direct to video format are called original video animation OVA or original animation video OAV and are typically not released theatrically or televised prior to home media release The emergence of the internet has led some animators to distribute works online in a format called original net anime ONA).
The home distribution of anime releases were popularized in the 1980s with the VHS and Laser Disc formats The VHS NTSC video format used in both Japan and the United_States States is credited as aiding the rising popularity of anime in the 1990s The Laser Disc and VHS formats were transcended by the DVD format which offered the unique advantages including multiple subtitling and dubbing tracks on the same disc The DVD format also has its drawbacks in the its usage of region coding adopted by the industry to solve licensing piracy and export problems and restricted region indicated on the DVD player The Video CD VCD format was popular in Hong_Kong Kong and Taiwan but became only a minor format in the United_States States that was closely associated with bootleg copies.
History.
Anime arose in the early 20th century when Japanese filmmakers experimented with the animation techniques also pioneered in France Germany the United_States States and Russia A claim for the earliest Japanese animation is Katsudō Shashin an undated and private work by an unknown creator In 1917 the first professional and publicly displayed works began to appear Animators such as Ōten Shimokawa and Seitarou Kitayama produced numerous works with the oldest surviving film being Kouchi's Namakura Gatana a two-minute clip of a samurai trying to test a new sword on his target only to suffer defeat The 1923 Great Kantō earthquake resulted in widespread destruction to Japan's infrastructure and the destruction of Shimokawa's warehouse destroying most of these early works.
By the 1930s animation was well established in Japan as an alternative format to the live-action industry It suffered competition from foreign producers and many animators such as Noburō Ōfuji and Yasuji Murata who still worked in cheaper cutout animation rather than cel animation Other creators such as Kenzō Masaoka and Mitsuyo Seo nonetheless made great strides in animation technique they benefited from the patronage of the government which employed animators to produce educational shorts and propaganda The first talkie anime was Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka produced by Masaoka in 1933 By 1940 numerous anime artists organizations had risen including the Shin Mangaha Shudan and Shin Nippon Mangaka The first feature length animated film was Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors directed by Seo in 1944 with sponsorship by the Imperial Japanese Navy.
The success of The Walt Disney Company's 1937 feature film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs profoundly influenced many Japanese animators In the 1960s manga artist and animator Osamu Tezuka adapted and simplified many Disney animation techniques to reduce costs and to limit the number of frames in productions He intended this as a temporary measure to allow him to produce material on a tight schedule with inexperienced animation staff Three Tales aired in 1960 was the first anime shown on television The first anime television series was Otogi Manga Calendar aired from 1961 to 1964.
The 1970s saw a surge of growth in the popularity of manga Japanese comic books and graphic novels many of which were later animated The work of Osamu Tezuka drew particular attention he has been called a legend and the god of manga His work – and that of other pioneers in the field – inspired characteristics and genres that remain fundamental elements of anime today The giant robot genre known as mecha outside Japan for instance took shape under Tezuka developed into the Super Robot genre under Go Nagai and others and was revolutionized at the end of the decade by Yoshiyuki Tomino who developed the Real Robot genre Robot anime like the Gundam and The Super Dimension Fortress Macross series became instant classics in the 1980s and the robot genre of anime is still one of the most common in Japan and worldwide today In the 1980s anime became more accepted in the mainstream in Japan although less than manga and experienced a boom in production Following a few successful adaptations of anime in overseas markets in the 1980s anime gained increased acceptance in those markets in the 1990s and even more at the turn of the 21st century In 2002 Spirited Away a Studio Ghibli production directed by Hayao Miyazaki won the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival and in 2003 at the 75th Academy Awards it won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Genres.
Anime are often classified by target demographic including kodomo children's shōjo girls shounen boys and a diverse range of genres targeting an adult audience Shoujo and shounen anime sometimes contain elements popular with children of both sexes in an attempt to gain crossover appeal Adult anime may feature a slower pace or greater plot complexity that younger audiences typically find unappealing as well as adult themes and situations A subset of adult anime works feature pornographic elements and are labeled R18 in Japan but internationally these works are grouped together under the term hentai Japanese for pervert By contrast a variety of anime subgenres across demographic groups incorporate ecchi sexual themes or undertones without depictions of sexual intercourse as typified in the comedic or harem genres due to its popularity among adolescent and adult anime enthusiasts incorporation of ecchi elements in anime is considered a form of fan service.
Anime's genre classification is different from other types of animation and does not lend itself to simple identity Gilles Poitras compared the labeling Gundam 0080 and its complex depiction of war as a giant robot anime akin to simply labeling War and Peace a war novel Science fiction is a major anime genre and includes important historical works like Tezuka's Astro Boy and Yokoyama's Tetsujin 28-go A major subgenre of science fiction is mecha with the Gundam metaseries being iconic The diverse fantasy genre includes works based on Asian and traditions and folklore examples include the Japanese feudal fairytale InuYasha and the depiction of Scandinavian goddesses who move to Japan to maintain a computer called Yggdrasil in Oh My Goddess Genre crossing in anime is also prevalent such as the blend of fantasy and comedy in Dragon Half and the incorporation of slapstick humor in the crime anime Castle of Cagliostro Other subgenres found in anime include magical girl harem sports martial arts literary adaptations medievalism and war.
Genres have emerged that explore homosexual romances While originally pornographic in terminology yaoi male homosexuality and yuri female homosexuality are broad terms used internationally to describe any focus on the themes or development of romantic homosexual relationships Prior to 2000 homosexual characters were typically used for comedic effect but some works portrayed these characters seriously or sympathetically.
Attributes.
Anime differs greatly from other forms of animation by its diverse art styles methods of animation its production and its process Visually anime is a diverse art form that contains a wide variety of art styles differing from one creator artist and studio While no one art style predominates anime as a whole they do share some similar attributes in terms of animation technique and character design Any other visual variation falls under the artists as they see fit.
Animation technique.
Anime follows the typical production of animation including storyboarding voice acting character design and cel production Since the 1990s animators have increasingly used computer animation to improve the efficiency of the production process Artists like Noburō Ōfuji pioneered the earliest anime works which were experimental and consisted of images drawn on blackboards stop motion animation of paper cutouts and silhouette animation Cel animation grew in popularity until it came to dominate the medium In the 21st century the use of other animation techniques is mostly limited to independent short films including the stop motion puppet animation work produced by Tadahito Mochinaga Kihachirō Kawamoto and Tomoyasu Murata Computers were integrated into the animation process in the 1990s with works such as Ghost in the Shell and Princess Mononoke mixing cel animation with computer-generated images Fuji Film a major cel production company announced it would stop cel production producing an industry panic to procure cel imports and hastening the switch to digital processes.
Prior to the digital era anime was produced with traditional animation methods using a pose to pose approach The majority of mainstream anime uses fewer expressive key frames and more in-between animation.
Japanese animation studios were pioneers of many limited animation techniques and have given anime a distinct set of conventions Unlike Disney animation where the emphasis is on the movement anime emphasizes the art quality and let limited animation techniques make up for the lack of time spent on movement Such techniques are often used not only to meet deadlines but also as artistic devices Anime scenes place emphasis on achieving three-dimensional views and backgrounds are instrumental in creating the atmosphere of the work The backgrounds are not always invented and are occasionally based on real locations as exemplified in Howl's Moving Castle and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya Oppliger stated that anime is one of the rare mediums where putting together an all-star cast usually comes out looking tremendously impressive".
The cinematic effects of anime differentiates itself from the stage plays found in animation Anime is cinematically shot as if by camera including panning zooming distance and angle shots to more complex dynamic shots that would be difficult to produce in reality In anime the animation is produced before the voice acting contrary to animation which does the voice acting first this can cause lip sync errors in the Japanese version.
Characters.
Body proportions of human anime characters tend to accurately reflect the proportions of the human body in reality The height of the head is considered by the artist as the base unit of proportion Head heights can vary but most anime characters are about seven to eight heads tall Anime artists occasionally make deliberate modifications to body proportions to produce super deformed characters that feature a disproportionately small body compared to the head many super deformed characters are two to four heads tall Some anime works like Crayon Shin-chan completely disregard these proportions such that they resemble cartoons.
A common anime character design convention is exaggerated eye size The animation of characters with large eyes in anime can be traced back to Osamu Tezuka who was deeply influenced by such early animation characters as Betty Boop who was drawn with disproportionately large eyes Tezuka is a central figure in anime and manga history whose iconic art style and character designs allowed for the entire range of human emotions to be depicted solely through the eyes The artist adds variable color shading to the eyes and particularly to the cornea to give them greater depth Generally a mixture of a light shade the tone color and a dark shade is used Cultural anthropologist Matt Thorn argues that Japanese animators and audiences do not perceive such stylized eyes as inherently more or less foreign However not all anime have large eyes For example the works of Hayao Miyazaki are known for having realistically proportioned eyes as well as realistic hair colors on their characters.
Hair in anime is often unnaturally lively and colorful or uniquely styled The movement of hair in anime is exaggerated and hair action is used to emphasize the action and emotions of characters for added visual effect Poitras traces hairstyle color to cover illustrations on manga where eye-catching artwork and colorful tones are attractive for children's manga Despite being produced for a domestic market anime features characters whose race or nationality is not always defined and this is often a deliberate decision such as in the Pokémon animated series.
Anime and manga artists often draw from a common canon of iconic facial expression illustrations to denote particular moods and thoughts These techniques are often different in form than their counterparts in animation and they include a fixed iconography that is used as shorthand for certain emotions and moods These expression are often exaggerated and are typically comedic in nature For example a male character may develop a nosebleed when aroused stemming from a Japanese old wives tale A variety of visual symbols are employed including sweatdrops to depict nervousness visible blushing for embarrassment or glowing eyes for an intense glare.
Music.
The opening and credits sequences of most anime television episodes are accompanied by Japanese pop or rock songs often by reputed bands They may be written with the series in mind but are also aimed at the general music market and therefore often allude only vaguely or not at all to the themes or plot of the series Pop and rock songs are also sometimes used as incidental music insert songs in an episode often to highlight particularly important scenes More often than not background music is employed as an added flavor to series either to drive story plot lines or to simply to decorate particular scenes and animated sequences Furthermore some series offer all applied music available in the form of OST or original soundtracks.
Industry.
The animation industry consists of more than 430 production companies with some of the major studios including Toei Animation Gainax Madhouse Gonzo Sunrise Bones TMS Entertainment Nippon Animation Studio Pierrot and Studio Ghibli Many of the studios are organized into a trade association The Association of Japanese Animations There is also a labor union for workers in the industry the Japanese Animation Creators Association Studios will often work together to produce more complex and costly projects as done with Studio Ghibli's Spirited Away An anime episode can cost between US$100,000 and US$300,000 to produce In 2001 animation accounted for 7% of the Japanese film market above the 4.6% market share for live-action works The popularity and success of anime is seen through the profitability of the DVD market contributing nearly 70% of total sales Spirited Away 2001 is the highest-grossing anime film with US$274,925,095.
The anime market for the United_States States was worth approximately $2.74 billion in 2009 Dubbed animation began airing in the United_States States in 2000 on networks like The WB and Cartoon Network's Adult Swim In 2005 this resulted in five of the top ten anime titles having previously aired on Cartoon Network As a part of localization some editing of cultural references may occur to better follow the references of the non-Japanese culture The cost of English localization averages US $10,000 per episode.
The industry has been subject to both praise and condemnation for fansubs the addition of unlicensed and unauthorized subtitled translations of anime series or films Fansubs which were originally distributed on VHS bootlegged cassettes in the 1980s have been freely available and disseminated online since the 1990s Fansubbers tend to adhere to an unwritten code to destroy or no longer distribute an anime once an official translated or subtitled version becomes licensed although fansubs typically continue to circulate through file sharing networks.
Legal international availability of anime on the internet has changed in recent years with simulcasts of series available on websites like Crunchyroll.
Awards.
The anime industry has several annual awards which honor the year's best works Major annual awards in Japan include the Ōfuji Noburō Award the Mainichi Film Award for Best Animation Film the Animation Kobe Awards the Japan Media Arts Festival animation awards the Tokyo Anime Award and the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year In the United_States States anime films compete in the ICv2.com Anime Awards There were also the Anime Awards which were designed to recognize excellence in anime titles nominated by the industry and were held only once in 2006 Anime productions are also nominated and win awards not exclusively for anime.
Influence on world culture.
Anime has become commercially profitable in countries as demonstrated by early commercially successful adaptations of anime such as Astro Boy Since the 19th century many Westerners have expressed a particular interest towards Japan and anime has dramatically exposed more Westerners to the culture of Japan.
Fan response.
Anime clubs gave rise to anime conventions in the 1990s with the anime boom a period marked by increased popularity of anime These conventions are dedicated to anime and manga and include elements like cosplay contests and industry talk panels Cosplay a portmanteau for costume play is not unique to anime and has become popular in contests and masquerades at anime conventions Japanese culture and words have entered English usage through the popularity of the medium including otaku a derogatory Japanese term commonly used in English to denote a fan of anime and manga Anime enthusiasts have produced fan fiction and fan art including computer wallpaper and anime music videos.
Anime style.
As anime itself became increasingly popular anime styling has been inevitably the subject of both satire and serious creative productions Parks Chinpokomon and Good Times with Weapons episodes Adult Swim's Perfect Hair Forever and Nickelodeon's Kappa Mikey are examples of satirical depictions of Japanese culture and anime Some works have sparked debate for blurring the lines between satire and serious anime style productions such as the anime style production These anime styled works have become defined as anime-influenced animation in an attempt to classify all anime styled works of non-Japanese origin Some creators of these works cite anime as a source of inspiration and like the production team for Ōban Star-Racers moved to Tokyo to collaborate with a Japanese production team When anime is defined as a style rather than as a national product it leaves open the possibility of anime being produced in other countries A series dubbed as the Middle East's First Anime Show is currently in production which is currently looking for funding The web-based series RWBY is produced using an anime art style and has been declared to be anime In addition the series will be released in Japan under the label of anime per the Japanese definition of the term and referenced as an American-made anime Defining anime as style has been contentious amongst fans with John Oppliger stating The insistence on referring to original art as Japanese anime or manga robs the work of its cultural identity."


Economy of Azerbaijan

Azerbaijan has an economy that has completed its post-Soviet transition into a major oil based economy with the completion of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline from one where the state played the major role Azerbaijan's GDP grew 41.7% in the first quarter of 2007 possibly the highest of any nation worldwide.
Such rates cannot be sustained but despite reaching 26.4% in 2005 second highest GDP growth in the world in 2005 only to Equatorial_Guinea Guinea and 2006 over 34.6% world highest in 2008 dropped to 10.8% and dropped further to 9.3% in 2009 The real GDP growth rate for 2011 was expected at 3.7% but had dropped to 1%.
Large oil reserves are a major contributor to the economy The national currency the Azerbaijani manat was stable in 2000 depreciating 3.8% against the dollar The budget deficit equaled 1.3% of GDP in 2000.
Progress on economic reform has generally lagged behind macroeconomic stabilization The government has undertaken regulatory reforms in some areas including substantial opening of trade policy but inefficient public administration in which commercial and regulatory interests are co-mingled limit the impact of these reforms The government has largely completed privatization of agricultural lands and small and medium-sized enterprises In August 2000 the government launched a second-stage privatization program in which many large state enterprises will be privatized Since 2001 the economic activity in the country is regulated by the Ministry of Economic Development of Azerbaijan Republic.
Economic history.
Modern era.
Through the Soviet period Azerbaijan had always been more developed industrially than Armenia and Georgia two neighboring Transcaucasia countries - but also less diversified as a result of slow investment in non-oil sector With a history of industrial development of more than 100 years Azerbaijan proved to be a leading nation in Southern Caucasus throughout the turmoil of Soviet Union collapse in early 1990s until nowadays.
Republic era.
Oil remains the most prominent product of Azerbaijan's economy with cotton natural gas and agriculture products contributing to its economic growth over the last five years More than $60 billion was invested into Azerbaijan's oil by major international oil companies in AIOC consortium operated by BP Oil production under the first of these PSAs with the Azerbaijan International Operating Company began in November 1997 and now is about 500,000 b/d People visit petroleum spas or oil spas to bathe in the local crude in Naftalan A leading caviar producer and exporter in the past Azerbaijan's fishing industry today is concentrated on the dwindling stocks of sturgeon and beluga in the Caspian Sea.
Azerbaijan shares all the problems of the former Soviet republics in making the transition from a command to a market economy but its energy resources brighten its long-term prospects Azerbaijan has begun making progress on economic reform and old economic ties and structures are slowly being replaced An obstacle to economic progress including stepped up foreign investment is the continuing conflict with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
In 1992 Azerbaijan became member of the Economic Cooperation Organization In 2002 the Azerbaijani merchant marine had 54 ships In March 2001 Azerbaijan concluded a gas agreement with Turkey providing a future export market for Azerbaijan.
Azerbaijan has concluded 21 production-sharing agreements with various oil companies An export pipeline that transports Caspian oil to the Mediterranean from Baku through Tbilisi Georgia to Ceyhan Turkey the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline became operational in 2006 The pipeline is expected to generate as much as $160 billion in revenues for the country over the next 30 years The recent high price of oil is highly beneficial to Azerbaijan's economy as the nation is in the midst of an oil boom Eastern Caspian producers in Kazakhstan also have expressed interest in accessing this pipeline to transport a portion of their production.
In 2010 Azerbaijan entered into top eight biggest oil suppliers to EU countries with €9.46 billion In 2011 the amount of investment in Azerbaijan was $20 billion a 61% increase from 2010 According to Minister of Economic Development of Azerbaijan Shahin Mustafayev in 2011 $15.7 billion was invested in non-oil sector while the rest - in oil sector."
In 2012 because of its economic performance after the Soviet breakup Azerbaijan predicted to become Tiger of Caucasus In 2012 Globalization and World Cities Research Network study ranked Baku as gamma level Global city.
Macro-economic trend.
The following is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Azerbaijan at market prices with figures in millions of Manats.
For purchasing power parity comparisons the US dollar was exchanged at 1,565.88 Manats only Currently the new Manat is in use with an exchange rate of about 1 manat = $1.10 Mean graduate pay was $5.76 per manhour in 2010.
For more than a century the backbone of the Azerbaijani economy has been petroleum which represented 10 percent of Azerbaijan’s GDP in 2005 and is projected to double to almost 20 percent of GDP in 2007 Now that oil companies are able to tap deepwater oilfields untouched by the Soviets because of poor technology Azerbaijan is considered one of the most important areas in the world for oil exploration and development Proven oil reserves in the Caspian Basin which Azerbaijan shares with Russia Kazakhstan Iran and Turkmenistan are comparable in size to the North Sea although exploration is still in the early stages.
Sectors of the economy.
Agriculture.
Azerbaijan has the largest agricultural basin in the region About 54,9 percent of Azerbaijan is agricultural lands At the beginning of 2007 there were 4,755,100 hectares of utilized agricultural area In the same year the total wood resources counted 136 million m³ Azerbaijan's agricultural scientific research institutes are focused on meadows and pastures horticulture and subtropical crops green vegetables viticulture and wine-making cotton growing and medicinal plants In some lands it is profitable to grow grain potatoes sugar beets cotton and tobacco Livestock dairy products and wine and spirits are also important farm products The Caspian fishing industry is concentrated on the dwindling stocks of sturgeon and beluga.
Some portions of most products that were previously imported from abroad have begun to be produced locally among them are Coca Cola by Coca Cola Bottlers LTD beer by Baki-Kastel parquet by Nehir and oil pipes by EUPEC Pipe Coating Azerbaijan).
Manufacturing.
In 2007 mining and hydrocarbon industries accounted for well over 95 per cent of the Azerbaijani economy Diversification of the economy into manufacturing industries remain a long-term issue.
As of late 2000s the defense industry of Azerbaijan has emerged as an autonomous entity with a growing defense production capability The ministry is cooperating with the defense sectors of Ukraine Belarus and Pakistan Along with other contracts Azerbaijani defence industries and Turkish companies Azerbaijan will produce 40mm revolver grenade launchers 107mm and 122mm MLRS systems Cobra 4×4 vehicles and joint modernization of BTR vehicles in Baku.
Services.
Financial and business services.
The GDP growth rates observed in Azerbaijan during last years made the country one of the fastest growing economies in the world But the banking sector of Azerbaijan has yet to tap the vast growth potential that should be achievable due to the continuation of the high economic growth For this reason the banking sector remains small in relation to the size of the Azerbaijani economy Since 2002 important stages of restructuring of the banking system have started to be carried out Taking into consideration entry of big oil revenues in the country as a logical result of successful oil strategy and in this base as the banks were ready to an effective transfer of their financial resources to the strategic goals development strategy was made for 2002–2005.
By 1 April 2010 47 banks 631 bank branches function in Azerbaijan One of banks was founded with participation of state capital 23 of foreign capital To the same date 98 non-bank credit organizations operate in the republic along with banks Growth of real money incomes of population development of trust in bank system improving the legal bases of protection of interests of creditors and depositors in particular launch of ‘Deposits Insurance Fund’ were the criteria characterizing rapid growth of deposits of population As of 1 April 2010 bank deposits of population were equal to 2,4 billion AZN 33,3% of them were long-term deposits higher than a year As of 1 April 2010 bank credits to customers is 8.5 bn AZN which makes 70.5% of bank assets Special weight of private sector in structure of credit investments is higher than 82% 7 bn AZN).
Telecommunications.
In the 21st century a new oil and gas boom helped to improve the situation in the Azerbaijan's science and technology sectors and the government launched a campaign aimed at modernization and innovation The government estimates that profits from the information technology and communication industry will grow and become comparable with those from oil production.
Azerbaijan has a large and steadily growing Internet sector mostly uninfluenced by the global financial crisis rapid growth is forecast for at least five more years.
The country has also been making progress in developing its telecoms sector The Ministry of Communications & Information Technologies MCIT as well as being an operator through its role in Aztelekom is both a policy-maker and regulator Public pay phones are available for local calls and require the purchase of a token from the telephone exchange or some shops and kiosks Tokens allow a call of indefinite duration As of 2009 there were 1,397,000 main telephone lines and 1,485,000 internet users There are five GSM providers Azercell Bakcell Azerfon Nar Mobile Aztrank Catel mobile network operators and one CDMA.
Tourism.
Tourism is an important part of the economy of Azerbaijan The country was a well-known tourist spot in the 1980s However the fall of the Soviet Union and the Nagorno-Karabakh War during the 1990s damaged the tourist industry and the image of Azerbaijan as a tourist destination.
It was not until the 2000s that the tourism industry began to recover and the country has since experienced a high rate of growth in the number of tourist visits and overnight stays In the recent years Azerbaijan has also becoming a popular destination for religious spa and health care tourism During winter the Shahdag Winter Complex offers skiing.
The government of Azerbaijan has set the development of Azerbaijan as an elite tourist destination a top priority It is a national strategy to make tourism a major if not the single largest contributor to the Azerbaijani economy These activities are regulated by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Azerbaijan.
Currency system.
The Azerbaijani manat is the currency of Azerbaijani denominated as the manat subdivided into 100 qapik The renminbi is issued by the Bank of Azerbaijan the monetary authority of Azerbaijan The ISO 4217 abbreviation is AZN The Latinised symbol is The manat is held in a floating exchange-rate system managed primarily against the US dollar The rate of exchange Azerbaijani manat per US$1 on August 14 2014 was AZN 0.78.
There is a complex relationship between Azerbaijan's balance of trade inflation measured by the consumer price index and the value of its currency Despite allowing the value of the yuan to float Azerbaijan's central bank has decisive ability to control its value with relationship to other currencies.
Infrastructure.
Energy.
Two thirds of Azerbaijan is rich in oil and natural gas The region of the Lesser Caucasus accounts for most of the country's gold silver iron copper titanium chromium manganese cobalt molybdenum complex ore and antimony In September 1994 a 30-year contract was signed between the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic SOCAR and 13 oil companies among them Amoco BP ExxonMobil Lukoil and Statoil As oil companies are able to tap deepwater oilfields untouched by the Soviet exploitation Azerbaijan is considered one of the most important spots in the world for oil exploration and development Meanwhile the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan was established as an extra-budgetary fund to ensure the macroeconomic stability transparency in the management of oil revenue and the safeguarding of resources for future generations.
Azeriqaz a sub-company of SOCAR intends to ensure full gasification of the country by 2021.
Transportation.
The convenient location of Azerbaijan on the crossroad of major international traffic arteries such as the Silk Road and the South-North corridor highlights the strategic importance of transportation sector for the country’s economy The transport sector in the country includes roads railways aviation and maritime transport.
Azerbaijan is also an important economic hub in the transportation of raw materials The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline BTC became operational in May 2006 and extends more than 1,774 kilometers through the territories of Azerbaijan Georgia and Turkey The BTC is designed to transport up to 50 million tons of crude oil annually and carries oil from the Caspian Sea oilfields to global markets The Caucasus Pipeline also stretching through the territory of Azerbaijan Georgia and Turkey became operational at the end of 2006 and offers additional gas supplies to the European market from the Shah Deniz gas field Shah Deniz is expected to produce up to 296 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year Azerbaijan also plays a major role in the EU-sponsored Silk Road Project.
In 2002 the Azerbaijani government established the Ministry of Transport with a broad range of policy and regulatory functions In the same year the country became a member of the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic The highest priority being upgrading the transport network and transforming transportation services into one of the key comparative advantages of the country as this would be highly conducive to the development of other sectors of the economy.
In 2012 the construction of Kars–Tbilisi–Baku railway expected to provide transportation between Asia and Europe through connecting the railways of China and Kazakhstan in the east with Turkey's Marmaray to the European railway system in the west Broad gauge railways in 2010 stretched for and electrified railways numbered By 2010 there were 35 airports and one heliport.
Business environment.
As of October 2014 Azerbaijan holds the highest foreign investment per capita among the Commonwealth of Independent States CIS countries Germany for example has invested approximately $760 million into the Azerbaijani economy and approximately 177 German companies operate within Azerbaijan Since gaining its independence companies have invested $174 billion into Azerbaijan Foreign investment accounts for around half of that amount.
In 2008 Azerbaijan was cited as the top reformer by the World Bank's Doing Business report:

Atanasoff–Berry computer

The Atanasoff–Berry computer ABC was the first automatic electronic digital computer an early electronic digital computing device that has remained somewhat obscure To say that it was the first is a debate among historians of computer technology as it was not programmable Many credit John Mauchly and J Presper Eckert creators of the ENIAC which came into use in July 1946 with the title Others cite the contender Colossus a development team headed by Tommy Flowers demonstrated Colossus to be working on December 8 1943 The world's first electronic digital computer that was programmable it ran at a remarkable for the time 5.8 MHz Designed and used exclusively for code breaking during World War II after the war alternative uses were considered but they remained in use for their original purpose until the late 1950s.
Some historians argue that the credit undisputedly belongs to Iowa State mathematics and physics professor John Vincent Atanasoff for his work with the ABC with the help of graduate student Clifford Berry Conceived in 1937 the machine was not programmable being designed only to solve systems of linear equations It was successfully tested in 1942 However its intermediate result storage mechanism a paper card writer/reader was unreliable and when John Vincent Atanasoff left Iowa State College for World War II assignments work on the machine was discontinued The ABC pioneered important elements of modern computing including binary arithmetic and electronic switching elements but its special-purpose nature and lack of a changeable stored program distinguish it from modern computers The computer was designated an IEEE Milestone in 1990.
Atanasoff and Berry's computer work was not widely known until it was rediscovered in the 1960s amidst conflicting claims about the first instance of an electronic computer At that time the ENIAC was considered to be the first computer in the modern sense but in 1973 a U.S District Court invalidated the ENIAC patent and concluded that the ENIAC inventors had derived the subject matter of the electronic digital computer from Atanasoff see Patent dispute).
Design and construction.
According to Atanasoff's account several key principles of the Atanasoff–Berry Computer were conceived in a sudden insight after a long nighttime drive to Rock Island Illinois during the winter of 1937–38 The ABC innovations included electronic computation binary arithmetic parallel processing regenerative capacitor memory and a separation of memory and computing functions The mechanical and logic design was worked out by Atanasoff over the next year A grant application to build a proof of concept prototype was submitted in March 1939 to the Agronomy department which was also interested in speeding up computation for economic and research analysis $5,000 of further funding to complete the machine came from the nonprofit Research Corporation of York City.
The ABC was built by Atanasoff and Berry in the basement of the physics building at Iowa State College during 1939–42 The initial funds were released in September and the 11-tube prototype was first demonstrated in October 1939 A December demonstration prompted a grant for construction of the full-scale machine The ABC was built and tested over the next two years A January 15 1941 story in the Des Moines Register announced the ABC as an electrical computing machine with more than 300 vacuum tubes that would compute complicated algebraic equations but gave no precise technical description of the computer The system weighed more than seven hundred pounds 320 kg It contained approximately 1 mile 1.6 km of wire 280 dual-triode vacuum tubes 31 thyratrons and was about the size of a desk.
It was not a Turing complete computer which distinguishes it from more general machines like contemporary Konrad Zuse's Z3 1941 or later machines like the 1946 ENIAC 1949 EDVAC the University of Manchester designs or Alan Turing's post-War design of ACE at NPL and elsewhere Nor did it implement the stored program architecture that made practical fully general-purpose reprogrammable computers.
The machine was however the first to implement three critical ideas that are still part of every modern computer:
In addition the system pioneered the use of regenerative capacitor memory as in the DRAM still widely used today.
The memory of the Atanasoff–Berry Computer was a pair of drums each containing 1600 capacitors that rotated on a common shaft once per second The capacitors on each drum were organized into 32 bands of 50 30 active bands and 2 spares in case a capacitor failed giving the machine a speed of 30 additions/subtractions per second Data was represented as 50-bit binary fixed point numbers The electronics of the memory and arithmetic units could store and operate on 60 such numbers at a time 3000 bits).
The alternating current power line frequency of 60 Hz was the primary clock rate for the lowest level operations.
The arithmetic logic functions were fully electronic implemented with vacuum tubes The family of logic gates ranged from inverters to two and three input gates The input and output levels and operating voltages were compatible between the different gates Each gate consisted of one inverting vacuum tube amplifier preceded by a resistor divider input network that defined the logical function The control logic functions which only needed to operate once per drum rotation and therefore did not require electronic speed were electromechanical implemented with relays.
Although the Atanasoff–Berry Computer was an important step up from earlier calculating machines it was not able to run entirely automatically through an entire problem An operator was needed to operate the control switches to set up its functions much like the electro-mechanical calculators and unit record equipment of the time Selection of the operation to be performed reading writing converting to or from binary to decimal or reducing a set of equations was made by front panel switches and in some cases jumpers.
There were two forms of input and output primary user input and output and an intermediate results output and input The intermediate results storage allowed operation on problems too large to be handled entirely within the electronic memory The largest problem that could be solved without the use of the intermediate output and input was two simultaneous equations a trivial problem.)
Intermediate results were binary written onto paper sheets by electrostatically modifying the resistance at 1500 locations to represent 30 of the 50 bit numbers one equation Each sheet could be written or read in one second The reliability of the system was limited to about 1 error in 100,000 calculations by these units primarily attributed to lack of control of the sheets material characteristics In retrospect a solution could have been to add a parity bit to each number as written This problem was not solved by the time Atanasoff left the university for war-related work.
Primary user input was decimal via standard IBM 80 column punched cards and output was decimal via a front panel display.
Function.
The ABC was designed for a specific purpose the solution of systems of simultaneous linear equations It could handle systems with up to twenty-nine equations a difficult problem for the time Problems of this scale were becoming common in physics the department in which John Atanasoff worked The machine could be fed two linear equations with up to twenty-nine variables and a constant term and eliminate one of the variables This process would be repeated manually for each of the equations which would result in a system of equations with one fewer variable Then the whole process would be repeated to eliminate another variable.
George W Snedecor the head of Iowa State's Statistics Department was very likely the first user of an electronic digital computer to solve real world mathematics problems He submitted many of these problems to Atanasoff.
Patent dispute.
On June 26 1947 J Presper Eckert and John Mauchly were the first to patent a digital computing device ENIAC much to the surprise of Atanasoff The ABC had been examined by John Mauchly in June 1941 and Isaac Auerbach a former student of Mauchly's alleged that it influenced his later work on ENIAC although Mauchly denied this Shurkin pg 280-299 In 1967 Honeywell sued Sperry Rand in an attempt to break their ENIAC patents arguing the ABC constituted prior art The United_States States District Court for the District of Minnesota released its judgement on October 19 1973 finding in Honeywell v Sperry Rand that the ENIAC patent was a derivative of John Atanasoff's invention.
Campbell-Kelly and Aspray conclude:
The case was legally resolved on October 19 1973 when U.S District Judge Earl R Larson held the ENIAC patent invalid ruling that the ENIAC derived many basic ideas from the Atanasoff–Berry Computer Judge Larson explicitly stated Replica.
The original ABC was eventually dismantled when the University converted the basement to classrooms and all of its pieces except for one memory drum were discarded In 1997 a team of researchers led by John Gustafson from Ames Laboratory located on the Iowa State campus finished building a working replica of the Atanasoff–Berry Computer at a cost of $350,000 The replica ABC is now on permanent display in the first floor lobby of the Durham Center for Computation and Communication at Iowa State University As of May 2012 it is on loan to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View California for a major exhibition.


Alexander I of Scotland

Alexander I c 1078 – 23 April 1124 Medieval Gaelic Alaxandair mac Maíl Coluim Modern Gaelic Alasdair mac Mhaol Chaluim and nicknamed The Fierce was King of the Scots from 1107 to his death.
Life.
Alexander was the fifth son of Malcolm III by his wife Margaret of Wessex grandniece of Edward the Confessor Alexander was named after Pope Alexander II.
He was the younger brother of King Edgar who was unmarried and his brother's heir presumptive by 1104 and perhaps earlier In that year he was the senior layman present at the examination of the remains of Cuthbert at Durham prior to their re-interment He held lands in Scotland north of the Forth and in Lothian.
On the death of Edgar in 1107 he succeeded to the Scottish crown but in accordance with Edgar's instructions their brother David was granted an appanage in southern Scotland Edgar's will granted David the lands of the former kingdom of Strathclyde or Cumbria and this was apparently agreed in advance by Edgar Alexander David and their brother-in-law Henry I of England In 1113 perhaps at Henry's instigation and with the support of his Anglo-Norman allies David demanded and received additional lands in Lothian along the Upper Tweed and Teviot David did not receive the title of king but of prince of the Cumbrians and his lands remained under Alexander's final authority.
The dispute over Tweeddale and Teviotdale does not appear to have damaged relations between Alexander and David although it was unpopular in some quarters A Gaelic poem laments:It's bad what Malcolm's son has done,<br>dividing us from Alexander;<br>he causes like each king's son before,<br>the plunder of stable Alba.
The dispute over the eastern marches does not appear to have caused lasting trouble between Alexander and Henry of England In 1114 he joined Henry on campaign in Wales against Gruffudd ap Cynan of Gwynedd Alexander's marriage with Henry's illegitimate daughter Sybilla de Normandy may have occurred as early as 1107 or as at late as 1114.
William of Malmesbury's account attacks Sybilla but the evidence argues that Alexander and Sybilla were a devoted but childless couple and Sybilla was of noteworthy piety Sybilla died in unrecorded circumstances at Eilean nam Ban Kenmore on Loch Tay in July 1122 and was buried at Dunfermline Abbey Alexander did not remarry and Walter Bower wrote that he planned an Augustinian Priory at the Eilean nam Ban dedicated to Sybilla's memory and he may have taken steps to have her venerated.
Alexander had at least one illegitimate child Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair who was later to be involved in a revolt against David I in the 1130s He was imprisoned at Roxburgh for many years afterwards perhaps until his death some time after 1157.
Alexander was like his brothers Edgar and David a notably pious king He was responsible for foundations at Scone and Inchcolm His mother's chaplain and hagiographer Thurgot was named Bishop of Andrews or Cell Rígmonaid in 1107 presumably by Alexander's order The case of Thurgot's would-be successor Eadmer shows that Alexander's wishes were not always accepted by the religious community perhaps because Eadmer had the backing of the Archbishop of Canterbury Ralph d'Escures rather than Thurstan of York Alexander also patronised Andrews granting lands intended for an Augustinian Priory which may have been the same as that intended to honour his wife.
For all his religiosity Alexander was not remembered as a man of peace John of Fordun says of him:
He manifested the terrible aspect of his character in his reprisals in the Mormaerdom of Moray Andrew of Wyntoun's Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland says that Alexander was holding court at Invergowrie when he was attacked by men of the Isles Walter Bower says the attackers were from Moray and Mearns Alexander pursued them north to Stockford in Ross near Beauly where he defeated them This says Wyntoun is why he was named the Fierce The dating of this is uncertain as are his enemies identity However in 1116 the Annals of Ulster report Ladhmann son of Domnall grandson of the king of Scotland was killed by the men of Moray The king referred to is Alexander's father Malcolm III and Domnall was Alexander's half brother The Mormaerdom or Kingdom of Moray was ruled by the family of Macbeth Mac Bethad mac Findláich and Lulach Lulach mac Gille Coemgáin not overmighty subjects but a family who had ruled Alba within little more than a lifetime Who the Mormaer or King was at this time is not known it may have been Óengus of Moray or his father whose name is not known As for the Mearns the only known Mormaer of Mearns Máel Petair had murdered Alexander's half-brother Duncan II Donnchad mac Maíl Coluim in 1094.
Alexander died in April 1124 at his court at Stirling his brother David probably the acknowledged heir since the death of Sybilla succeeded him.
